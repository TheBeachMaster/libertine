* Signatures ending in .asc or .gpg
* curlrc files for most options (allowing customisation)
* better download location (outside of the chroot) with support for mirrors, ie so we can ship a files-only, CD-like set
	* No need to go mental
	* But allows us to offer our own host quite simply
* Better use of unxz, etc, so we optimise the linux sign check
* linking of certificate-authorities to particular packages
* Reduce need to sudo

* Integrate, if only slightly, with the cvedetails.com database (if only for a package name mapping)
	* Vendor name, eg GNU, vendor id 72
	* Example: GNU Bash is http://www.cvedetails.com/product/21050/GNU-Bash.html
	* Not everything is listed, of course

* SUID / GUID binary (and library) finding
	* Remove the attributes
	* Whitelist of permitted binaries PER package

* Post-package removal of binaries / files

* Post-package permissions changes
	* Apply Attributes
		* chattr
		* lsattr
	* Apply ACLs
		* getfacl
		* setfacl
	* Change regular perms
		* Particularly, for binaries, remove world permissions
		* Actually, for all files, remove world permissions
	* Create an user
	* Create a group
	* Add a binary to a particular group / user combination
	* Mock group of groups

* Attributes (chattr / lsattr, part of e2fsprogs)
	Security
	* a  append-only, unless root / CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
	* d  not backed up by dump (ie sensitive,  file system local, etc)
	* h  file is or was >2TB (read-only)
	* i  file is read-only, can not be written to or linked to (can only be made writable by root / CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE)
		- very useful for binaries and libraries and even config
	* s  deleted file is zeroed (limitations, but seems like a sensible choice for most files) (ignored on ext2/3)
	* T  tell the block allocator to put subfolders into different blocks
		- useful for stormmq; useful for /home to split up users
	* u  undeletion! (ignored on ext2/3)
	Other
	* A  atime is not modified
	* D  dirsync, synchronous write of changes
	* e  extents
	* I  hash indexed (read-only)
	* j  sync of data to ext3 journal before writing to file; no effect if ext3 mounted data=journal
	* S  'sync mount option' per file
	* t  no tail-merging. Can't imagine much use for this
	Compression
	* E  compression error (read-only)
	* c  automatic disk compression (ignored on ext2/3)
	* X  disk compression adjustment
	* Z  compression dirty (read-only)

* ACLs
	

* Post-package sha512 / sha1 sums of all files
	Also record file layout, file system, file perms, ACLs, any user id & group id, File type (file/folder/symlink/char device/block device/pipe/domain socket)
* Linux capabilities and audit
