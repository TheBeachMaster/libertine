* Signatures ending in .asc or .gpg
* curlrc files for most options (allowing customisation)
* better download location (outside of the chroot) with support for mirrors, ie so we can ship a files-only, CD-like set
	* No need to go mental
	* But allows us to offer our own host quite simply
* Better use of unxz, etc, so we optimise the linux sign check
* linking of certificate-authorities to particular packages

* Integrate, if only slightly, with the cvedetails.com database (if only for a package name mapping)
	* Vendor name, eg GNU, vendor id 72
	* Example: GNU Bash is http://www.cvedetails.com/product/21050/GNU-Bash.html
	* Not everything is listed, of course
